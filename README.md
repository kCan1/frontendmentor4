## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with custom properties)
- Tailwind CSS
- React (functional components)
- Vite (build tool)
- Flexbox & CSS Grid for layout
- Responsive units (rem, em, %, clamp)

### What I Learned

This project helped reinforce my understanding of:

- Responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Managing component state and props in React
- Implementing accessible and interactive UI elements
- Using Vite for fast React development
- Improving semantic layout for better accessibility and structure
- When to use lists vs. tables for presenting data (e.g., lists for steps/ingredients, tables for nutrition facts)

#### Challenges & Solutions

I had trouble:

- Applying custom local fonts in Tailwind and ensuring they loaded across all components
- Styling ordered list numbers and custom markers for unordered lists
- Building accessible, clean table styles for the nutrition section

By extending Tailwind’s config for fonts, using list utilities combined with small custom CSS, and following MDN best practices for table semantics, I overcame these hurdles.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Explore advanced accessibility features
- Improve animation and transition effects
- Refine component reusability and modularity
- Further enhance semantic HTML structure
